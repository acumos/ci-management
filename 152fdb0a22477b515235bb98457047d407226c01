      "message": "Please add a comment here explaining briefly the content of this image, which I believe has custom-to-project additions like protoc and python, but not docker.  In other words, it\u0027s not generic.  Actually this might be a good place to list ALL the images available in the Acumos Jenkins environment. Thx.",

      "message": "Personally I don\u0027t think this is a good place to put this info and have started advising folks that \"build-node\" should not be a default setting. Projects should choose in their own project files the build-node appropriate for their projects.\n\nAs for figuring what\u0027s available in the image I think it\u0027s better to link to the directory packer/provision/\u003cimage\u003e.yaml This is where all the images are defined and would ensure that docs are not desynced from reality.",
